Edge AI Benefits Report

Benefits of Edge AI for Real-time Applications:

1. Low Latency: Processing happens locally, eliminating network delays
2. Bandwidth Efficiency: No need to send large amounts of data to cloud
3. Privacy & Security: Data remains on device, reducing exposure risks
4. Offline Operation: Functions without internet connectivity
5. Cost Reduction: Lower cloud computing and data transfer costs
6. Real-time Processing: Immediate responses for time-sensitive applications

Deployment Steps:

1. Train and optimize model for target hardware
2. Convert to TensorFlow Lite format
3. Deploy to edge device (Raspberry Pi, mobile device)
4. Integrate with camera/sensor input
5. Implement continuous monitoring and updates
